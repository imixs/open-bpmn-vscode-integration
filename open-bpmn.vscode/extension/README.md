**Open BPMN** is a free BPMN 2.0 modeling tool to create and edit .bpmn files based on the _Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0)_, proposed by the Object Management Group (OMG).

BPMN 2.0 is an open standard to describe business processes that can be visualized in diagram editors and executed by process engines compliant with the BPMN 2.0 standard. This makes BPMN an interoperable, interchangeable and open standard in the field of business process management. BPMN was intended for users at all levels, from the business analysts who create the initial design, to the developers who implement the technical details, and finally, to the business users responsible for managing and monitoring the processes.

# Extensibility

Open BPMN is a free BPMN 2.0 modeling platform that can be extended and customized by any BPMN 2.0 compliant execution engine. Open BPMN is based on the Eclipse Graphical Language Server Platform (GLSP) providing an open-source framework for building diagram editors based on modern web technologies.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a graphical BPMN editing framework that can be extended in various ways by different solutions to create an agile and innovative community around the BPMN standard.
