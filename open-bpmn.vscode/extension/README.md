# Extensibility

BPMN 2.0 introduces an extensibility mechanism that allows extending standard BPMN elements with additional properties and behavior. It can be used by modeling tools to add non-standard elements or Artifacts to satisfy a specific need, such as the unique requirements of a vertical domain, and still have a valid BPMN Core.

Open Source Workflow Engines like [Imixs-Workflow](https://www.imixs.org) integrate Open BPMN into there tooling platforms and extend the core features of BPMN 2.0 with platform specific functionality.
